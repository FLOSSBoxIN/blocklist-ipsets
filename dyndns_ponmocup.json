The malware powering the botnet has been around since 2006 and itâ€™s known under various names, including Ponmocup, Vundo, Virtumonde, Milicenso and Swisyn. It has been used for ad fraud, data theft and downloading additional threats to infected systems. Ponmocup is one of the largest currently active and, with nine consecutive years, also one of the longest running, but it is rarely noticed as the operators take care to keep it operating under the radar.
